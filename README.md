# Farty Corn

**Farty Corn** is a whimsical, fast-paced game featuring a gassy unicorn. Inspired by the classic Flappy Bird, this game takes it up a notch with unique power-ups and chaotic gameplay. Get ready to navigate your unicorn through the skies, using not just your wits but also some serious gas!

## üöÄ Project Status
**Farty Corn** is currently in development and not yet ready for version 1.0 release. Stay tuned for future updates!

## üéÆ Game Concept
Imagine **Flappy Bird**, but with a twist. In **Farty Corn**, you control a unicorn that propels itself with, well... farts! This game introduces **power-ups** to spice up the traditional gameplay:

- **Jetpacks** to give you an extra boost!
- **Direction-changing power-ups** to flip the gameplay upside down.
- More power-ups to come that will completely change the dynamic of the game!

## üîß Installation
Currently, there's no version available for installation. Please check back soon for updates!

## ‚ö° Features (Planned)
- **Power-Ups:** Different effects to boost or challenge your gameplay.
- **Multiple Power Effects:** Switch directions, gain speed, or slow down with a variety of game-altering mechanics.
- **Fast-paced Chaos:** The game gets progressively harder as you navigate through increasingly tricky levels.
- **Gassy Unicorn:** Because why not?
